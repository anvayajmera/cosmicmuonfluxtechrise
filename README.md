# cosmicmuonfluxtechrise
Our project will include 2 methods for detecting ionizing radiation from the sun. We will have 2 CosmicWatch detectors (initially prototyped by MIT researchers) as the main detection method. We wish to submit our proposal to NASA TechRise later, with a prototype built with $200 grant.
