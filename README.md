# cosmicmuonfluxtechrise
My project will include 2 methods for detecting ionizing radiation from the sun. We will have 2 CosmicWatch detectors (initially prototyped by MIT researchers) as the main detection method. We wish to submit our proposal to NASA TechRise later, with a prototype built with $200 grant.
There are two versions we want to make in the CAD, however:
Version 1: Designed for a Styrofoam box for a self-planned HAB flight, in case we don't win TechRise
Version 2: Designed under the specifications of the TechRise box, if we do get selected

I made this project because it was the ideal next step for me, as I am well-versed in the electrical and mechanical aspects of overall robot creation, but have not yet build boards on my own (where I buy a bunch of cheap parts and hand-solder them onto a board). Moreover, for AP Research, I wanted to make my project actually meaningful in STEM for data collection.
